# Pre-mat workshop

This tutorial will help you get started with RStudio Server and set up your 
first project. 

## Quick start with rstudio server

In order to avoid every student having to install `R` themselves and deal with
operating-system-specific issues, we have set up RStudio Server 
and given each student access. If you are unfamiliar with `R` or RStudio, take 
some time to familiarize yourself with each. 

Once you are ready, navigate to the URL you were provided with. This screen
should appear:

Enter the username and password you were given at the start of the workshop.
This will start an RStudio session in your browser. If it worked, you should
see your home screen:

The only difference between using RStudio Server and RStudio (besides 
the fact that one is in a browser...) is that your scripts, packages, and data 
are stored on the cloud computer instead of your personal computer. 

To get files onto the cloud computer you can:
1. Upload the files from your personal computer using the 'Upload' button in
the right-hand 'files' panel.
2. Use the 'Terminal' to download files using shell commands:
```
wget 
```






One benefit of RStudio Server is that it can be accessed without any knowledge
of the machine that is hosting it. However, every student does have an account
on the linux cloud server tied to their RStudio Server account. If you wish 
to access the linux machine,
